    "We want to make sure that the chains with the same sequence in different cif files are all named the same way. To make that happen, we do pairwise sequence alignment between all sequences and a reference sequence. The reference sequence can be from a given reference structure, or from a consensus sequence (calculated from the given dataset). The ID re-assignment goes as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "Chain A of test.cif has a 0.8 similarity score with chain B of the reference structure ref.cif, but only a 0.4 similarity score with chain A of the reference structure rif.cif. Then we will change the name of chain A of test.cif, to Chain B. A message will be printed on screen: \n",

    "Also note, there is a possibility of another chain in test.cif, already being labeled as Chain B. In that case, a prompt will be printed on screen, asking us to change the name of the original chain B. Make sure to keep track of the names of the chains. However, at the end of this process, we should have a complete dataset with consistent chain IDs among all structures. \n",

    "TIM is a homodimer. The monomers are labeled as A and B. It is thus interesting that in the case of `2y62+00.cif` we see a reassignment of the Chain ID. This is because of our naïve similarity score. We are just counting the fraction of identical residues. And in this case, because chain A and chain B in the reference, did not have the same number of residues, there was a difference in the score. "
