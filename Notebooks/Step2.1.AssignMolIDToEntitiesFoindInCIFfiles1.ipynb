    "- You can assign the same MolID to different entities. In that case these entities will be concatenated. User needs to accept each concatenation manually. \n",
    "- Inspecting the list of entities will allow users to identify structures that needs to be removed from the ensemble.\n",
    "- Make sure that the MolIDs of the structures in the ensemble are consistent (the same chain is named always the same, even in different structures).\n",
