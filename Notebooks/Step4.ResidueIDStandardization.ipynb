    "This is the final step to create our curated ensemble. Now that the chains have been standardized, we are going to make sure that the residues numbers are consistent among all structures. This is done by performing a multiple sequence alignment (MSA) for all the sequences in our ensemble, and then generating a new numbering system based on the MSA. Thus, it is very important for users to inspect the MSA generated during this step. This notebook shows two examples of a TIM dataset and shows the difference between having a single organism dataset as opposed to a multiple organism dataset, and how this affects the MSA. There is not one sole correct way to do this step and the users need to decide the purpose of the analysis they intend to perform to get the results that work best for them. \n",

    ">**NOTE 1:** For this tutorial, we will not use the whole ensemble we downloaded. We will use a subsample of only 6 structures. The next cells will create the new directory. Notice that we are choosing these 6 sctructures from the ones we downloaded in Step 0. We chose these ones to highlight some possible issues you may run into when running this script. \n",
