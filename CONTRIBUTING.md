## :page_with_curl: Code of Conduct

Before you start, review our [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/fatipardo/PDBClean-0.0.2/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). Bad behavior will not be tolerated. 

## :incoming_envelope: Opening an Issue

Sign in to your GitHub account and create a **New Issue** in [GitHub issues](https://github.com/fatipardo/PDBClean-0.0.2/issues)

Before you create a new entry, please check if the issue has already been reported in [GitHub](https://github.com/fatipardo/PDBClean-0.0.2/issues). And review our [documentation](https://github.com/fatipardo/PDBClean-0.0.2/tree/master/Notebooks). 

Make sure to select an appropriate label for the issue before you submit it (e.g. bug, enhancement, etc).

### :bug: Bug reports 

Please write a bug report that you would like to receive.

- Include the operating system and processor on which the code is being run on.
- Include the location of where the issue arose.
- If you get an error message, include it in the issue.
- Use [GitHub-flavored Markdown](https://help.github.com/en/github/writing-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax). Especially put code blocks and console outputs in backticks (```). This improves readability.

> **If an issue already exists.**
Comment on the existing issue to add more information or leave a reaction on their issue. This helps us become aware of which issue is being faced more commonly and allows us to prioritize which issues to solve first.

### :art: Feature request

- Make sure to select the enhancement label when submitting an issue.
- Be precise about the proposed outcome of the feature and how it relates to existing features. Include implementation details if possible.
- Do not open a duplicate feature request. Search for existing feature requests first. If you find your feature (or one very similar) previously requested, comment on that issue.

## :construction: Do you want to help fix an issue? 

- Comment "take" to the issue you want to fix and we will assign it to you.
- When you submit a pull request, add the GitHub issue number in the title.
