# PDBClean-0.0.2

The original code in this repository comes from: https://test.pypi.org/project/PDBClean/#files

We are working on fixing bugs in the code, and writing a more comprehensive documentation.

Fixed bugs:

  - Bug on cleanutils that crashed step 1 (change L from list to string).
  - Print correct biological assembly on separate files
  - In pdbutils.py , remove existing seqfile before updating.
